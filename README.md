# Particle Disaggregation Code
This repository contains Matlab code to calculate the evolution of the 
particle size distribution in a single layer of the water column. The 
model allows for particle aggregation, disaggregation, and sinking, 
and also changes in aggregate size from cell growth (see `SetUpCoag.m`).
